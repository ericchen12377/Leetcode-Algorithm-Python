Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this nodeâ€™s descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:

Given tree s:

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
Given tree t:
   4 
  / \
 1   2
Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.
