Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: []
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 200
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
